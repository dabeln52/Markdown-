During the Grand Prix in _Brazil_ Max was instucted to give back the postition to Prez his teamate but failed todo so. They initaly swaped postions to see if Max could catch the car in front but failed todo. Redbull wanted them to swap again to help Prez in the fight for second in the drivers Championship.

    "I told you already last time that you guys, dont ask that again to me. Okay? Are we clear of that?
